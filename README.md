# World War Waves - Wizard Battle of the Funk
Game developed during the Global Game Jam 2017. The theme was "waves" so we decided to make a game in which a wizard uses elemental waves to destroy his rival's appartment.

How to play : WWW is a 2 players game and need Windows XBox joypad to play. Player 2 must destroy the Player 1 appartment with magic waves while Player 1 has to repair the stuff.
